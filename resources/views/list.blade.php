<section class="rms-about">
    <p>Rahway Main St. was created by a Rahway citizen in response to the early 2020 COVID-19 outbreak. Many local businesses, government offices, churches, and other organizations have needed to change procedures. We've seen switches to takeout only, off-hours, virtual appointments, and more. With this radical shift in how we do business, Rahway Main St. was created to provide a "digital main street" for Rahway, New Jersey.</p>
