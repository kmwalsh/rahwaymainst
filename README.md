This was a site for posting businesses in Rahway, New Jersey during the COVID-19 pandemic. It was deprecated sometime in 2021.  It was [featured in the news](https://www.mycentraljersey.com/story/money/business/2020/04/09/local-business-directory-rahway-basking-ridge-asbury-digital-main-streets/2962215001/). It allowed users to log in and post and update their businsess hours. A lot of businesses were using Facebook to post updated hours and restricted products and similar changes due to COVID-19. At the time it was very awkward, so this site was an attempt at creating one centralized place for businesses my hometown.

It was a Laravel 7 app. It used Tailwind (first time ever).
